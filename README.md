Python 3.x
qrcode library

cd your-repo-name

Run the script using:
python your-script-name.py

When prompted, enter the URL or text you want to encode into a QR code.

Enter your URL: https://example.com

The generated QR code image will be saved as qrimg3.png in the current directory.
Customization
You can customize the QR code by modifying the parameters in the generate_qrcode function:

version: Controls the size of the QR code (1 is the smallest).
error_correction: Adjusts the error correction level (options: ERROR_CORRECT_L, ERROR_CORRECT_M, ERROR_CORRECT_Q, ERROR_CORRECT_H).
box_size: Sets the size of each box in pixels.
border: Defines the thickness of the border (in boxes).
For example, to generate a QR code for the URL "https://example.com", you would call the function with this text, and the output image will be saved as qrimg3.png.
